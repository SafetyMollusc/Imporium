  * Playtime: ~45 minutes
  * Rules: explained by the designer

## Function
  * Start of the game is slow - feels like there is very little a player can do on their turn
  * Many moving parts make it difficult to keep track
  * Symbols are useful for generalization but text would be helpful for people with poor memories ("Race for the Galaxy" problem)

## Enjoyment
  * Story and theme are enjoyable
  * Once things got going, once the machines started running things were more entertaining
