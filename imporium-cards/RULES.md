# IMPORIUM v.00.04

## Intro

Welcome to Unseemly University. You have all enrolled in our prestigious Siegfried College, the summoner school. You all presumably hope to graduate among the most famous (or infamous) alumni making life easier (or harder) for the uninitiated. Over the years you will learn to harness and command all the various denizens of the underworld.

The Unseemly University prides itself in only producing the highest quality graduates and as such the coming years will be difficult. That being said, you've made it this far so you likely have a desire to succeed, so good luck with your first term.

That being said...

Crisis! Imps are pouring out into the lab area! If they aren't stopped the lab will be overrun and you'll have to retake the semester! The instructor is too preoccupied with his plans for the day so it's up to you... and this may be an opportunity to make a quick buck on the side.

Imporium is a game for 2-4 players. Become the most successful entrepreneurial summoner apprentice by building the most magnificent machine for processing imps and/or build the largest, most extravagant collection of imp-based merchandise for sale to ~~hapless dupes~~ loyal customers. 

Players take it in turns taking actions collecting imps from the portal, grabbing machine components from the laboratory warehouse, managing their tamed imps and mashing imps into interesting shapes, based on recipes. Each machine component and completed recipe is worth points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Recipes are available from the main supply, but you have to show initiative to obtain them. All students will start with the same collection of tools.

## Objective

Your goal as a summoning student or apprentice at Siegfried College is to build a lucrative side business selling contrivances which you have cobbled together using some of the imps that have been pouring out of the portal and some twine. The most successful side hustle wins.

## Components

The game includes the following components:
  * Imps - 18 cubes in each of 6 colours (red, yellow, green, blue, pink, gray)
  * Portal (bag) - Bag for storing the imps (releasing them into the world)
  * Lab Equipment - a deck of [x] square cards that will be used by players to ensnare and process imps coming out of the portal
  * Recipe Cards - a deck of [y] cards that will be used by players as blueprints to combine imps into useful (??) things
  * Turn order track and one (1) pawn for each player colour to indicate turn order
  * Six (6) dispenser tokens in each player colour
  * Four (4) How To Play / How To Win reference cards, one for each player
  * Four (4) Player Aids, one in each colour, indicating current player stamina, imp collection, school credit and dispensers
  * Coins in several denominations to track player money

## Game Setup

Each player selects a colour and takes the matching turn pawn and dispenser tokens. Each player is dealt eight (8) basic tube cards, four splitters and one aspirator. Each player places their aspirator face up on the table and shuffles the remainder of the Lab Equipment cards into a personal deck, drawing the top six (6) cards to form their starting hand.

Place 6 imp cubes of each colour into the supply as well as 3 imps of each colour per player in the game. If, for example, Adam, Beth and Chase are playing, that means there should be 6+3+3+3 = 15 of each colour of cube in the supply.

Place one cube of each colour into the portal bag for each player around the table (i.e. if Adam and Beth are playing while Chase is sitting this one out because he got upset and needs a lie-down, that means there will be 1+1 = 2, two red cubes, two yellow cubes, etc.)

Each player places their pawn on the turn order track, position 1 on the track is taken by the person who most recently bought something they regret, and then position 2 by the next most recent regrettable purchase, and so on in reverse order. Note that you have to reveal what it was that you regret buying (and why). If nobody wants to admit to foolish purchases, randomly organize the pawns on the turn order track.

## Gameplay

Gameplay takes place over multiple days, each broken up into multiple phases.

### Phase 1: Imp Spawn

The player in position 1 on the turn order track reaches into the bag and grabs a certain number of imps without looking into the bag. The player must draw at least 1 cube, but may draw any number up to and including their current stamina. The bag is then passed to the next player in the turn order track who does the same thing, and then the third player, and so on. All players reveal their imps simultaneously and the imps are placed in the portal location. If any player reveals zero cubes, that player loses one stamina. If any player reveals more imps than they have stamina, that player chooses whether to lose one stamina and discard imps down to their current stamina level OR lose as many stamina as there are an excess of imps (say Beth has a stamina of 6 and has drawn 10 cubes, she can either discard 4 cubes of her choice from her 10 and lose one stamina, bringing her to 6 cubes and 5 stamina, or she can choose to lose 4 stamina and keep all the cubes, bringing her to 2 stamina and 10 cubes).

Note that the imps go into a common portal area, so there is no guarantee you will gather the imps you drew.

### Phase 2: Action!

Players take it in turn, starting with position 1 on the present day track and then to position 2, etc.

Per action, each player does the following:
  * The active player discards any number of Lab Equipment cards (either from that player's hand or from the tableau in front of them)
  AND EITHER
  * The active player plays one (1) Lab Equipment card to their tableau 
  OR
  * The active player spends earned school credit on a certain number of buys they have earned and then moves their pawn from the present day track to the next day track, to the lowest number posisition available.

Once a player has moved their pawn to the next day track they will not take any further Actions on this day. That player counts the number of cards in their tableau and in their hand and draws up to 7 cards total (adding any new cards to their hand).

Once all players have passed, move the pawns from the next day track to the present day track (without changing the order)

### Phase 3: Attract Imps

Starting with the first player and proceeding based on the present day track, if a player has at least one imp draw remaining, they take one imp from the portal, place it into an aspirator and reduce their total imp draw by one.

Each player must have a balanced number of imps in aspirators. Each aspirator in a player's tableau must have at least one imp in it before a second imp can be placed in any one aspirator by that player.

This phase ends once all players are at zero imp draw remaining OR there are no imps remaining in the portal.

### Phase 4: Process Imps

Players take it in turn, based on the present day track, processing one imp through their laboratories. Move the imp through, duplicating, combining, changing, dispensing or consuming based on the laboratory equipment encountered.

Once all imps are processed, play proceeds to the next phase.

### Phase 5: Imp Escape!

Starting with player 1 in the present day track, the player to that player's left selects an imp which shall escape through player 1's lab, freeing imps from partially completed recipes or attacking the player. If the selected colour of imp appears on one of that player's incomplete recipes, they lose that imp and both imps are placed in the "escaped" pile. If there are no imps of that colour, the single escaping imp goes to the "escaped" pile, and player 1 loses 1 stamina. Then player 2 has an imp escape (and the player to player 2's left selects an imp to escape), etc. until all imps have escaped.

### Phase 5a: End Game

If one of the following conditions are met, the game ends:
  * Three or more colours of imps are completely gone from the supply
  * One player has sold at least 6 recipes
  * 8 imps per player have escaped (if there are 3 players and there are 24 or more imps in the "escaped" pile)

Proceed to "Scoring" if any or all of the above are true, otherwise proceed to Phase 6! Another day will soon be beginning (huzzahs!)

### Phase 6: Cleanup

Return all discarded imps to the supply (not including imps in the "escaped" pile).
Each player selects one imp from the supply for each aspirator they have in their tableau. They each then select one additional imp. All of these imps are added to the portal bag.

## Scoring

At the end of the game, for every four imps on incomplete recipes, gain 1 dollar (rounding down). For each completed recipe which has not been sold, gain half of the sale value (rounded down). Compare the bank of each player. The player with the most currency (in dollars) wins. If there is a tie, the player with the most sold recipes wins. If there is still a tie, time to play again - apparently you're not cutthroat enough.
