# IMPORIUM v.00.04

## Intro

Welcome to Unseemly University. You have all enrolled in our prestigious Siegfried College, the summoner school. You all presumably hope to graduate among the most famous (or infamous) alumni making life easier (or harder) for the uninitiated. Over the years you will learn to harness and command all the various denizens of the underworld.

The Unseemly University prides itself in only producing the highest quality graduates and as such the coming years will be difficult. That being said, you've made it this far so you likely have a desire to succeed, so good luck with your first term.

That being said...

Crisis! Imps are pouring out into the lab area! If they aren't stopped the lab will be overrun and you'll have to retake the semester! The instructor is too preoccupied with his plans for the day so it's up to you... and this may be an opportunity to make a quick buck on the side.

Imporium is a game for 2-4 players. Become the most successful entrepreneurial summoner apprentice by building the most magnificent machine for processing imps and/or build the largest, most extravagant collection of imp-based merchandise for sale to ~~hapless dupes~~ loyal customers. 

Players take it in turns taking actions collecting imps from the portal, grabbing machine components from the laboratory warehouse, managing their tamed imps and mashing imps into interesting shapes, based on recipes. Each machine component and completed recipe is worth points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Recipes are available from the main supply, but you have to show initiative to obtain them. All students will start with the same collection of tools.

## Objective
